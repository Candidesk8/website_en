Since this morning 11 o'clock, a new Duniter powered currency has come to life: it's name is **GTest**, the very last « testing » currency whose goal is to validate Duniter's code.

This currency won't last more that 2 months, but is opened to any active user who would like to contribute by sending us suggestions and track bugs.

For more details, see [the official announcement on our forum](https://forum.duniter.org/t/lancement-officiel-de-gtest/1619).
