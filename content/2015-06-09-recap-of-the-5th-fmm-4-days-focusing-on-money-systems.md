There we are! **5th FMM is now over**. It has been [a very rich experience of 4 days](http://blog.ucoin.io/ucoin-at-the-5th-freedom-money-meeting/ "uCoin at the 5th Freedom Money Meeting") focusing on money systems. Below is quick recap of what happened during these days for those of you who could not be here with us.
## First day: a dive into uCoin protocol

The very first day was a presentation made by your servitor (cgeek) about uCoin software & protocol. This was a travel across technical details about how is uCoin working, which are the rules and what is the life of currency propulsed by uCoin protocol.

The presentation was in French, but I took the time to translate it in case you wanted to read it. You can dowload the file here: [FMM5\_Presentation\_en](/files/FMM5_Presentation_en.odp "FMM5 uCoin presentation by cgeek").

## Second day: more about CuteCoin & uCoinApps softwares!

This day was an opportunity for client softwares to be presented. Let's see the two firsts: *CuteCoin* and *uCoinApps*.
### Cutecoin

The morning was dedicated to [Cutecoin](https://github.com/duniter/sakia), the very first client of uCoin software. We steped through:

*   Current state of the application
*   Work to be done
*   Development process (unit tests, continuous integration)
*   And incoming features

Currently, Cutecoin allows you to do all the core operations made possible by uCoin software. It is also the first allowing to have an overview of the network!

### uCoinApps

The afternoon was dedicated to uCoinApps, the little brother of Cutecoin as it is the second client for uCoin. uCoinApps is an Android application that allows you to:

*   Connect to an existing currency network
*   Create your personal account
*   Publish your identity
*   Certificate other members
*   See your account's balance
*   Transfer money

The application is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ucoin.ucoin). You may also find [a tutorial (french)](http://www.ucoin.fr/utiliser/ucoinapps-android/) for using it at [ucoin.fr](http://ucoin.fr).

The author of the application also made a presentation avaialble for download: [FMM5 uCoinApps Presentation (fr)](/files/FMM5-uCoinApps-Presentation-fr.odp).
## Third day: simulation of 160 years of money systems

This day was an opportunity for non-developers to discover a french game called [La Corbeille](http://www.valeureux.org/blog/les-jeux/jeu-la-corbeille/). This game consists in simulating an **economy** by producing values using the only available currency system. The goal is to understand the underlying code of a currency system and see the consequences of using it. During this session, we have tried 2 money systems:

*   Debt Money system (the one used by almost all currencies over the world,     including € and $) in the morning
*   Freedom Money system (the one used by uCoin) in the afternoon

The results of this session are available for download on GitHub: [LibreOffice Calc file](https://github.com/galuel/Geconomicus/raw/master/Exemple_de_suivi_tableur.ods).
Also, you can access the project [Ğeconomicus](https://github.com/galuel/Geconomicus) which provides a set of free graphics & tools to create your own economy simulations based on 80 years human lifetime. Here is a recap video of this journey (french), so as another resume on [creationmonetaire.info](http://www.creationmonetaire.info/2015/06/video-geconomicus-la-corbeille-aux-5emes-rencontres-des-monnaies-libres.html) :

## Fourth day: non-technical contributions

A last day was dedicated to other contributions than coding. These are more around the project, for example explanations, theoretical fundamentals, etc.
### A new mathematical demonstration

The morning has seen the demonstration by Stéphane Laborde, the author of the RTM (Relativity Theory of Money), that a currency with a given rate of money creation and providing a Basic Income to its people by using a tax **have an equivalent Freedom currency** that only uses money creation. This mathematical demonstration can be found in the last version of the RTM in this file: [Relativity Theory of Money (french)](http://trm.creationmonetaire.info/TheorieRelativedelaMonnaie.pdf).
### Presentation of David Chazalviel: "The RTM in color" and "The RTM for the kids"

[David Chazalviel](http://cuckooland.free.fr/index.html) gave us a presentation about his 2 last contributions for spreading about Freedom Money:

**The RTM in color** ([english](http://cuckooland.free.fr/TheRtmInColor.html) or [french](http://cuckooland.free.fr/LaTrmEnCouleur.html) version) is a brilliant web application to simulate and explore the concepts of a Freedom Money.

**The RTM for the kids** (available in [french](http://cuckooland.free.fr/LaTrmPourLesEnfants.html) only) is an interactive presentation trying to explain what is a Freedom Money and the RTM to kids, thanks to Elise and its fairy friend:

### Subscription to metab_brouzouf currency

The afternoon was the occasion for people to try Cutecoin and [subscribe to metab_brouzouf currency](http://forum.ucoin.io/t/subscribing-to-meta-brouzouf-testing-currency)! As you can see, we now are about 23 active members testing uCoin:

And here is the currency overview:

## Conclusion

This 1st edition of 2015 FMM was a very successful meeting with a lot of new people met and introduced to money codes, many technical details were explained and **the very first client applications** Cutecoin & uCoinApps have been presented and tested by final users! What will await us for [next FMM in Valence during November 2015](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Valence/@44.8679005,4.9135516,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47f55799c63221c7:0x408ab2ae4bfb580)? Coming months will tell us, but be sure a lot of work is to be achieved until then!
