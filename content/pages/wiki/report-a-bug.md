You may be able to detect a bug on one of Duniter's applications! If so, **please write a bug report**, as explained below.

### About GitHub

This is the preferred method. *Really, we prefer this one*: **this is our official list of bugs**.

If you are registered on GitHub, simply go on the good repositories :

* [Duniter tickets repository] (https://github.com/duniter/duniter/issues)
* [Sakia tickets repository] (https://github.com/duniter/sakia/issues)
* [Cesium tickets repository] (https://github.com/duniter/cesium/issues)
* [Silkaj tickets repository] (https://github.com/duniter/silkaj/issues)

Then put a title, and a description of the error encountered:

! [] ({Filename} /images/contribuer/ticket_github.png)

> ** /! \ Do not forget to validate by clicking the "Submit new issue" button! **

### On the forum

If you're really struggling to create the ticket on GitHub (it's a good opportunity to learn!), You can also create a topic on the forum:

! [] ({Filename} /images/contribuer/ticket_forum.png)

Make sure you:

* Give a title
* Give a description
* Select category "support"

Then validate. Someone will answer you, then *we will register your problem* on GitHub. But good, you reported a bug, this is the most important!
