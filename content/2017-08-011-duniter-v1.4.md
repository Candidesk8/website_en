Duniter version 1.4 is now [available for download](https://github.com/duniter/duniter/releases/tag/v1.4.15)!

## Changes

This version brings several improvements in network stability, notably through faster resolution of the * forks * of the blockchain. Also, pool identities and certifications are now more regularly resynchronized.

But the major change of this version is **the migration of JavaScript source code to TypeScript**.

For details on all these changes, see [release notes](https://github.com/duniter/duniter/releases/tag/v1.4.13).
